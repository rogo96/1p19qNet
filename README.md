"From diagnosis to visualization of IDH-mutant glioma via 1p/19q codeletion detection using weakly-supervised deep learning"

# Abstract

1p/19qNET is an advanced AI network designed to enhance glioma diagnosis and treatment. It predicts alterations in 1p and 19q chromosomes and classifies IDH-mutant gliomas using whole slide images (WSIs). With a weakly-supervised learning approach, it reduces reliance on human annotation and workload. Its superior predictive power over traditional FISH methods is demonstrated through training on extensive next-gen sequencing data and independent validation. The network not only provides explainable heatmaps for clinician use but also holds potential for broad applications in diverse tumor classifications.
